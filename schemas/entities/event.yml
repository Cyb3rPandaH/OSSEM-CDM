attributes:
- name: timestamp

  description: 'The most accurate timestamp of the log. Commonly this will be the
    original reporting timestamp from the log. However, if you believe the log timestamp
    has been altered or skewed (ie: either due to timezone issues or NTP skew)then
    replace this field with the most likely timestamp. Always keep the original log
    timestamp in the field creation_timestamp'

  sample_value: network-protocols
- name: event_ip_addr
  type: string

  sample_value: 10.10.10.10
- name: event_host_name
  type: string
  description: The host name from which the event/log came from. There may be multiple host names in an event (i.e. syslog could have forwarder host name), this field is to be the most true log host name (i.e. NOT the forwarders name).
