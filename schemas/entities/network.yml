description: Event fields used to define metadata about network information seen in a typical OSI layer. This includes data both from an endpoint as well as a network monitoring device/application (NSM, Firewall, IPS, IDS, etc...). This differentiates from data that is specific to Source and Destination specific information such as Source or Destination bytes, packets, IP address, mac address, TCP flags.
attributes:
- name: FingerprintNetworkCommunityId
  type: string
  description: Network community ID as outlined by the standard from https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec. Standardized hashing of network tuple. The combination, most commonly, of Source IP, Source Port, Destination IP, Destination Port, and IP Protocol allows pivoting between multiple log types
  sample_value: 1:EeVyZ07VGj1n0rld+xCLFdM+u8M=
- name: ApplicationName
  type: string
  description: Layer 7 (application) name specific to service/name/software as provided by a device or user
  sample_value: google-drive
- name: ApplicationProtocol
  type: string
  description: 'Layer 7 (application) in the OSI model. Ex: HTTP,SMB,FTP,SSH, etc.'
  sample_value: HTTP
- name: Bytes
  type: integer
  description: Total bytes for the session. If this field does not exist in the log source, then its possible in your ETL pipeline to combine the source and destination bytes.

  sample_value: outbound
- name: Initiated
  type: boolean
  description: 'Whether the session was initiated or received. Most commonly used in relation to an endpoint/device. False = the endpoint did not initiate the session (ie: was scanned or RDP connection made to it)'
  sample_value: 'TRUE'
- name: InnerVlanId
  type: integer

  sample_value: '150'
- name: IpBytes
  type: long
  description: Total IP bytes, according to ip headers, for the session. If this field does not exist in the log source, then its possible in your ETL pipeline to combine the source and destination bytes
  sample_value: '14564'
- name: MissedBytes
  type: long
  description: bytes that a network sensor or other system/application may have missed
  sample_value: '5'
- name: OuterVlanId
  type: integer
  description: Normally the VLAN can not be determined as source/destination and VLANs are stacked/wrapped. This is the VLAN on the "outside"
  sample_value: '160'
