description: Event fields used to define metadata about network information seen in
  a typical OSI layer. This includes data both from an endpoint as well as a network
  monitoring device/application (NSM, Firewall, IPS, IDS, etc...). This differentiates
  from data that is specific to Source and Destination specific information such as
  Source or Destination bytes, packets, IP address, mac address, TCP flags.
attributes:
- name: fingerprint_network_community_id
  type: string
  description: Network community ID as outlined by the standard from https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec.
    Standardized hashing of network tuple. The combination, most commonly, of Source
    IP, Source Port, Destination IP, Destination Port, and IP Protocol allows pivoting
    between multiple log types
  sample_value: 1:EeVyZ07VGj1n0rld+xCLFdM+u8M=

  sample_value: 'TRUE'

  sample_value: '150'
- name: ip_bytes
  type: long
  description: Total IP bytes, according to ip headers, for the session. If this field does not exist in the log source, then its possible in your ETL pipeline to combine the source and destination bytes
  sample_value: '14564'
- name: missed_bytes
  type: long
  description: bytes that a network sensor or other system/application may have missed
  sample_value: '5'
