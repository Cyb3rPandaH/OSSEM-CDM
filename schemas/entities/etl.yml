attributes:
- name: FormatApplied
  type: string

  description: During ETL processing, event is determined to be JSON (format)
  sample_value: 'true'
- name: FormatIsSyslog
  type: boolean
  description: 'During ETL processing, event is determined to be Syslog (format). Technically you could send data encoded in different format over syslog (ie: CEF or JSON), therefore an event/log can have this tag/field as well as other format fields'

- name: InfoTags
  type: string
  description: Use for any additional information about an event/log during ETL/processing pipeline. Commonly, you would use this for things that are rare but happen (i.e. parsing error for non conforming RFC). Use this field to alert or give context to a user/analyst when looking at the data.
