description: Event fields used to define specific metadata about the event during the processing of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline.
attributes:
- name: format_applied
  type: string
  description: Formatting or encoding applied during the ETL processing. Also referred

  type: boolean
  description: During ETL processing, event is determined to be CEF (format)
  sample_value: 'false'
- name: format_is_json
  type: boolean
  description: During ETL processing, event is determined to be JSON (format)
  sample_value: 'true'
- name: format_is_syslog
  type: boolean
  description: 'During ETL processing, event is determined to be Syslog (format).
    Technically you could send data encoded in different format over syslog (ie: CEF
    or JSON), therefore an event/log can have this tag/field as well as other format
    fields'
