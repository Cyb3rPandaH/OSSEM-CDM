description: 'Fields used to define metadata for a single field to include data from multiple fields with similar/same values/data.  This data is most commonly created from an ETL pipeline. Any fields below that contain a ''*'' indicates those are searches and not actual fields (key/values). This is because certain values are not desirable to copy/duplicate. However, because of a common schema we can still find are values for a specific common type, without duplicating or copying everything to one field!'
